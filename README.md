# FalkorFactor
A repository for code used to process and analyze data from the Falkor cruise. 

Metadata and some nice visualizations of the cruise are available in the MetaDataVis folder.

Raw files are stored on the Ingalls QE drive, and converted to .mzML 
via the RunMsconvert batch file (but ignored by Git).
